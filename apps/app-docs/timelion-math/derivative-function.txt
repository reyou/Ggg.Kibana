Monitoring network traffic is much more valuable when plotting the 
rate of change. The derivative() function is used do just that - plot 
the change in values over time. This can be easily done by appending the 
.derivative() to the end of an expression. Use the following expression 
to update your visualization:

.es(index=metricbeat*, timefield=@timestamp, metric=max:system.network.in.bytes).derivative()
