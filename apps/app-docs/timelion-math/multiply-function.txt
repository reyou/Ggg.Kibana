Now for the outbound traffic. Youâ€™ll need to add a similar calculation 
for system.network.out.bytes. Since outbound traffic is leaving your 
machine, it makes sense to represent this metric as a negative number. 
The .multiply() function will multiply the series by a number, the 
result of a series or a list of series. For this example, you will 
use .multiply(-1) to convert the outbound network traffic to a negative 
value. Use the following expression to update your visualization:

.es(index=metricbeat*, timefield=@timestamp, metric=max:system.network.in.bytes).derivative(), 
.es(index=metricbeat*, timefield=@timestamp, metric=max:system.network.out.bytes).derivative()
.multiply(-1)
