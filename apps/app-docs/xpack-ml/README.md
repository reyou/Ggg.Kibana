### Machine Learning

As datasets increase in size and complexity, the human effort required to
inspect dashboards or maintain rules for spotting infrastructure problems,
cyber attacks, or business issues becomes impractical. The X-Pack machine
learning features automatically model the normal behavior of your time series
data — learning trends, periodicity, and more — in real time to identify anomalies,
streamline root cause analysis, and reduce false positives.
